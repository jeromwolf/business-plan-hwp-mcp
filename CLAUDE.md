# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new project directory with no existing codebase. As the project develops, update this file with:

1. **Build and Development Commands** - Add commands for building, testing, and running the application once they are established
2. **Architecture Overview** - Document the high-level architecture and design patterns as they are implemented
3. **Key Dependencies** - List critical libraries and frameworks once chosen
4. **Project-Specific Conventions** - Document any unique conventions or patterns adopted by the team

## Current Setup

The project directory is currently empty. When initializing:
- Consider the project requirements before choosing a framework or technology stack
- Set up appropriate version control with `.gitignore` for the chosen technology
- Establish a clear directory structure from the beginning
